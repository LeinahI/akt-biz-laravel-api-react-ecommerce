# Docker Compose Configuration for Laravel API Kit with MySQL and Nginx
#
# This file defines a multi-container Docker application consisting of three services:
#
# SERVICE: host_docker (MySQL Database Service)
#   - Provides the MySQL 8.0 database for the application
#   - Service name 'host_docker' should match DB_HOST in the .env file
#   - Database name 'db_aktbiz_ecommerce_3' should match DB_DATABASE in .env
#   - Port 3306 (before colon) should match DB_PORT in .env
#   - Uses health checks to verify MySQL is ready before app starts
#   - Persists data using a named volume (db_data)
#
# SERVICE: app (Laravel Application Service)
#   - PHP-FPM application container built from the project's Dockerfile
#   - Depends on host_docker service being healthy before starting
#   - Mounts the entire project directory for development
#   - Runs in the laravel network to communicate with other services
#
# SERVICE: nginx (Nginx Web Server)
#   - Reverse proxy and web server serving the Laravel application
#   - Maps port 8000 on the host to port 80 in the container (access via localhost:8000)
#   - Uses app.conf configuration file from docker/nginx/ directory
#   - Depends on the app service being ready
#   - Routes all HTTP requests to the PHP-FPM app container
#
# NETWORKING:
#   - All services connected via 'laravel' bridge network for inter-container communication
#
# VOLUMES:
#   - db_data: Named volume for persistent MySQL database storage
