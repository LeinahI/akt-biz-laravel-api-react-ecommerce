# Nginx Server Configuration for Laravel API with PHP-FPM
#
# This file configures Nginx as a reverse proxy for the Laravel application
# running in a Docker container with PHP-FPM backend.
#
# BASIC CONFIGURATION:
#   - Listens on port 80 for HTTP traffic
#   - Uses catch-all domain (server_name _) to match all incoming requests
#   - Root directory points to Laravel's public folder (/var/www/public)
#   - Default index files are tried in order: index.php, index.html, index.htm
#
# REQUEST HANDLING:
#   - All requests are routed through Laravel's index.php via try_files directive
#   - This enables Laravel routing to handle all requests dynamically
#   - Allows serving static files (images, CSS, JS) directly if they exist
#
# FILE UPLOAD LIMITS:
#   - client_max_body_size is set to 20M to allow file uploads up to 20MB
#
# SECURITY HEADERS:
#   - X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking by restricting iframe embedding
#   - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
#   - X-XSS-Protection: Enables browser's built-in XSS protection
#
# PHP-FPM INTEGRATION:
#   - Forwards all PHP requests to 'app' container on port 9000
#   - Passes the real path and script filename to PHP-FPM
#   - Includes standard FastCGI parameters for proper request handling
#   - Hides the X-Powered-By header to improve security
#
# HIDDEN FILES & DIRECTORIES:
#   - Access to all hidden files/folders (starting with .) is denied
#   - Exception: .well-known directory is allowed (used for SSL certificates, etc.)
